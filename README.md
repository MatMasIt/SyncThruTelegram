# SyncThru Telegram Bot


![Example](example.png)



Receive alerts on your ink, tray, and drum levels of SyncThru-enabled Samsung printers on Telegram, and check their status.


## Installation

Simply clone the repository or download the files, the install requirements with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy its token into the config.

You need to run `main.py` for information polling and level messages
and `telegram.py` for the checking feature

A printer may be configured as a static-ip or a dynamic-ip printer, in which case the software will attempt to find its local ip given its serial number

Do not edit the `store.json` file if you do not know what you are doing, or you may crash the whole thing.

## Configuration

Here is an explainer

```json
{
    "printers": [
        {
            "ip": "192.168.1.2", // initial (or static) i√®

        }
    ],
    "update_interval": 600000, // how many seconds between updates
